# mediscan-api-demo

This is a demo project for the Mediscan API. It is a simple web application that allows you to scan a medicine package and see the results (i.e., manufacture date, expiry date, etc.) in a web page.

It is part of the main project "Real-time medicine packet recognition system in dispensing medicines" which focuses on the development of a system that can recognize medicine packets in real-time and provide information about the medicine.
